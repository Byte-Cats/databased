# Running a Project with Docker

## Prerequisites

To run a project with Docker, first ensure you have both docker and docker-compose installed. 
See their [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for information.

## Clone the Project Repository

Create a directory to store your cloned repositories. Move into the directory, then clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone [repository URL]
```
